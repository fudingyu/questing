# QuestServer

QuestServer is an attempt at making a slightly more extensible version of Mozilla's proof of concept game [BrowserQuest](https://github.com/mozilla/BrowserQuest).

Some of the code is brought straight across from the BrowserQuest implementation, and some is implemented slightly differently as a PoC for different entity definition formats.  A big thanks for making the source for BrowserQuest available as it allows for this kind of experimentation.
